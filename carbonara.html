    <h2>
      Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with spaghetti,
      pancetta, egg yolks, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese, all combined to
      create a creamy and flavorful sauce.
    </h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>4 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al
        dente, according to the package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta
        cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and return it to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
        diced pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Remove
        the pancetta/bacon from the skillet with a slotted spoon and transfer to
        a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic to the skillet with the rendered pancetta/bacon
        fat and cook for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant. Remove the skillet from
        the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, Parmesan cheese,
        Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the reserved pasta cooking water to the skillet with the garlic and
        pancetta/bacon fat and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the spaghetti to the skillet and toss to coat with the garlic and
        pancetta/bacon fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly stir in the egg yolk
        mixture until the spaghetti is well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the spaghetti among serving plates and sprinkle with the crispy
        pancetta/bacon.
